# FlashM

A still simple cli flash card application 
compatible with lesson files of [Pauker](http://pauker.sourceforge.net)

The project started 2011 with inspiration from
[FlashE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flashe/)
(2003) by Robie Lutsey

## Installation

This should run with both Python 2 and 3 except for the fullterm UI
which requires at least Python 3.6 (because of
[prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit).

```
pip install /path/to/FlashM
```

## Usage

You can run flashm with:

```
python -m flashm [optionsâ€¦]
```

optional arguments:              

```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit            
  -q, --quiet           turn off verbose output                    
  -i [{cli,fullterm}], --interaction [{cli,fullterm}]              
                        UI for interaction
```

This is a beta release.
