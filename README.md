A still simple cli flash card application 
compatible with lesson files of [Pauker](http://pauker.sourceforge.net)

## Changes

0.1.0 - The first version!

## Requirements

* Python available at http://python.org (included in most Linux 
  distributions)
* Any commandline emulator (terminal) of your choice (included in
  almost all operating systems)

## Installation

unzip (if compressed) and save into any folder you like!
make sure that you want to save lesson files in that directory
(optionally, you can create shortcuts of flashm.py 
on the desktop etc. for increased accessability)

## Usage

* Linux users can open a terminal in the installed directory and call
   ```
    python flashm.py
   ```
  OR click on a shortcut for the command
   ```
    python <PATH>/flashm.py
   ```
  where <PATH> should be substituted by your installation directory of 
  FlashM with the setting "execute in a command-line emulator" checked
* Other users could need to execute Python directly from its 
  installation path (e. g. Win: 'C:\Programs\Python\python.exe'). There
  you can import flashm.py with the command
    import <PATH>flashm
  where <PATH> should be substituted by your installation directory of 
  FlashM. Opening flashm.py with Python (like opening any document with
  a text editor) could in some cases happily open up a command line
  emulator with all what you need


This is a beta release.
